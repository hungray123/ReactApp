                        Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation.
                        As viewed from the Equator, the equinox Sun sets exactly due west in both Spring and Autumn.
                        As viewed from the middle latitudes, the local summer sun sets to the southwest for the Northern Hemisphere,
                        and to the northwest for the Southern Hemisphere.
