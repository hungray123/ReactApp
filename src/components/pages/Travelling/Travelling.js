                        Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar climates and temperate climates, between autumn and spring. 
                        Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. 
                        Different cultures define different dates as the start of winter,and some use a definition based on weather. 
                        When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa...
